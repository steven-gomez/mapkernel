# mapkernel

This repo contains scripts to synthesize tiled maps from low-resolution sketches (1 pixel per tile). A driving use case is programmatically generating 2D environment maps for games with non-photorealistic scenery, or "supersampling" a simple hand-drawn sketch into a high resolution version.

## Usage

```bash
$ python src/map.py Layer0.png Layer1.png LayerN.png
```

## Tile Neighbors and "Overlaps"

## Compositing Special Tiles

## Data Augmentation
